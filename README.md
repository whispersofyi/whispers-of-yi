# Whispers of YI

*A quiet voice in the scrollstorm — reflections, elemental whispers, and tools to navigate life’s flow.*

## 🌿 What is Whispers of YI?
Whispers of YI is not a school, not a doctrine — but a space.  
Here, BaZi is approached not as rigid calculation, but as a branch of Dao:  
a mirror for life’s seasons, elements, and quiet truths.

## 🌌 Why This Exists
You don’t need another guru.  
You don’t need another textbook.  
You only need a whisper that reminds you:  
*“The flame flickers in wind, but never forgets it burns.”*
